## Photon-RGB

Photon-RGB allows for the control of RGB lighting using a [Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io/). The Arduino sketch is included, and circuit diagram will be added shortly.

## Installation

With the device type deployed to SmartThings, create a device to represent your RGB item (ie: Under Cabinet Lighting), and specify your Particle Device ID and Authorization Token within the device.
