## Photon-RGB

Photon-RGB allows for the control of RGB lighting using a [Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io/). Use these purpose-built RGB LED strips under your kitchen cabinets, behind your TV, or anywhere you want dynamic RGB LED lighting!

## Parts List

Amazon affiliate links are provided below as a centralized list of all components required for this project. This list represents a single 2M strip. Components such as the MOSFETs and resistors are cheaper in packs of 10+ than buying individual, so you may have leftover components. Based on these costs and buying the items listed below, each 2M strip costs around $40. This list is subject to change as the design becomes finalized. I'm also working on custom PCBs to mount the components.

## Installation

With the device type deployed to SmartThings, create a device to represent your RGB item (ie: Under Cabinet Lighting), and specify your Particle Device ID and Authorization Token within the device.
