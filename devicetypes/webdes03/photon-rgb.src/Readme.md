## Photon-RGB

Photon-RGB allows for the control of RGB lighting using a [Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io/). Use these purpose-built RGB LED strips under your kitchen cabinets, behind your TV, or anywhere you want dynamic RGB LED lighting!

## Why Make vs Buy

For starters, it's more fun. But in all seriousness, the advantage to building these over buying off-the-shelf ZWave or Wifi LED strips is that you can customize them to go wherever you need them to. They're powered by 5V USB power, so feel free to use the USB port on your TV, or a portable battery pack stuck under your cabinets, and you'll have SmartThings controled RGB lights wherever you need them.

## Parts List

Amazon affiliate links are provided below as a centralized list of all components required for this project. Components such as the MOSFETs and resistors are cheaper in packs of 10 and 100, so you'll undoubtedly have leftover components. Based on these costs and buying the items listed below, each 2M strip costs around $40. This list is subject to change as the design becomes finalized. I'm also working on custom PCBs to mount the components.

## Installation

With the device type deployed to SmartThings, create a device to represent your RGB item (ie: Under Cabinet Lighting), and specify your Particle Device ID and Authorization Token within the device.
