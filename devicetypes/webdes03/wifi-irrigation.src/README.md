# Wifi-Irrigation Introduction

Wifi-Irrigation allows for the control of up to four sprinkler valves using [SmartThings](https://smartthings.com) and a [Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io/). The build guide and parts list are based on my build containing two sprinkler valves, but could be easily extended to support up to 4 valves/zones. Additional information, including a complete build guide is available at https://mike-greene.com/wifi-irrigation and https://github.com/webdes03/wifi-irrigation.
